            About Me
          </h2>

          <p class="about-text">
            I’m a third-year BSc Computer Science student studying Physics,
            Mathematics, and Computer Science under Sant Gadge Baba Amravati
            University. I currently attend a small-town college in Maregaon,
            Yavatmal district. My academic journey started from a modest place,
            but over the years I’ve worked consistently to improve my
            performance. That steady progress has taught me discipline,
            patience, and the value of showing up every day.
          </p>

            Journey & Projects
          </h3>

          <p class="about-text">
            My interest in computers and the internet started early. Instead of
            limiting myself to theory, I focused on building real projects from
            home. I’ve created a live component platform (uiVault), a café
            website, a small educational math game, and an anti-cheating exam
            system designed to discourage dishonest behavior during tests. Each
            project helped me understand how real applications are structured
            and how to turn ideas into working products.

            Skills & Mindset
          </h3>

          <p class="about-text">
            I’m not a senior developer yet, but I’m committed to learning by
            building. I’ve gained hands-on experience solving practical coding
            problems and have worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, C, C++,
            and MySQL at a strong foundational level. I’m persistent with my
            work, naturally curious about new technologies, and I prefer
            creating real, usable solutions. My focus is on continuous
            improvement — both academically and personally — through consistent
            effort and real-world practice.
